# course_v3_practice

## Goal
Here I make notebooks from [fastai classes part2](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=8). It's a great class for Deep Learning and homework session is the only thing I feel missing from it (bcz you need it to practice coding efficiently and intentionally).

## Usage
**TL;DR: Just open it and start filling the blanks in codes.**  
  
Details usage:  
1. Each question will start with a `#???` sign (so you can command+f to find it quickly).  
2. Each question is made out from class notebook with some code removed and hints added.  
3. Some tests are added to cells, so you will have a better idea whether you get one cell right or not.  
4. If you are stuck, try frame the problem youself and search online first.  
5. If you are stuck for long time (5 min+), peek the class notebook and try to go back to problem without using   command+c/command+v (i.e. type it out.)
